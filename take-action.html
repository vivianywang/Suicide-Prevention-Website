      <h2>1. Observe</h2>
      <p class="action">If you feel like someone you know may be experiencing mental health issues, observe their actions for anything irregular and habits being broken. Be especially alert if this continues for a long amount of time. Before going to talk to them, try to encourage healthy habits such as sleeping, eating, physical activity, taking the time to go outside and hanging out with friends.</p>
      
    <h2>2. Talk & Listen</h2>
    <p class="action">Let the person express their feelings towards you and let them know that you’re there for them. Do not try to dismiss their comments such as "Sometimes I just want to go to bed and never wake up" as teenage trama. Instead, try responding with more empathy. For instance, instead of saying “You have a good life, why would you end it?” say something like “You must really, really be hurting inside to consider ending your life.”</p>
    <h2>3. Seek Help</h2>
      
    <p class="action">Recommend a therapist to the person struggling. It could be a school therapist or a local mental health provider or even a national suicide hotline for guidance. Just make sure that they are getting the professional help so that they can get the best help that they can receive. As they are going through therapy, make sure that they know that you will also always be there and that you will be able to get through it. Say things like "Difficult times will always pass."</p>
    <h2>4. Remove lethal means</h2>
    <p class="action">Make sure that the person doesn’t have any guns that they can access or any drugs. Try to limit access to knives as well. Although there will still be other ways to go through with suicide, this will limit the person's options and would make it more obvious and easier to spot when the person might be planning on doing it, since they won't be able to do it at their house. </p>
